Chemical sensors have gained relevance in the last decades, particularly the subgroup of electrochemical sensors is the one with the larger growth rate.

This work had two fundamental goals. The first one was to synthesize and study mesoporous thin films (MTF) based on silicon dioxide to be used as perm-selective elements for an analyte or group of analytes. The second was the integration of these films in electrochemical sensors manufactured with microfabrication technologies, thus compatibilizing the bottom-up and top-down processes strategies.

During the first stage, MTF were deposited on gold electrodes, using different surfactants to tailor the pore size between  3 and \SI{10}{\nm} . Thermal treatments used for template removal negatively affect the electrode response. Therefore, alternative processes were developed for the calcination, allowing to condense the SiO$_2$ below \SI{130}{\celsius}, minimizing diffusive effects and expanding the spectrum of compatible substrates. The TMFs were characterized by ellipsoporosimetry, IR spectroscopy, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam microscopy.

In a second stage, the transport phenomena that take place through the MTP were studied using electrochemical techniques: cyclic voltammetry, alternating-current voltammetry and simulation by finite elements. The results allowed obtaining significant information of the systems, qualitatively (cases of exclusion, permeation and preconcentration) and quantitatively (diffusion coefficients, adsorption capacity, distances between redox sites, etc.). However, silica MTF dissolve after several electrochemical cycles, thus limiting the use of these systems as continuous sensors.

The main motivation of the thesis was centered in the manufacture of electrochemically based sensors. For this reason, Au electrodes were deposited, optimizing several designs, spinning conditions, substrates and functionalized surface, in order to improve the electrochemical performance and to optimize the adhesion of the MTF to the electrodes. At an advanced stage, Zr(IV) was incorporated into the precursor solutions, which significantly increased the chemical stability of the silicon MTFs against dissolution. Finally, these MTFs were functionalized with organic groups, aiming at giving a differential characteristic to each of the electrodes inside into the same sensor.

The results obtained allow scaling the manufacturing of sensors based on gold electrodes coated with MTF, obtaining potentially selective sensing systems, chemically stable, reproducible and easy to functionalize. The acquired knowledge is opens the path to advance in the development and design of patterned arrays of electrochemical sensors based on selective mesoporous thin films.
