abstract = {We use molecular dynamics simulations in order to understand the microscopic origin of the asymmetric growth mechanism in gold nanorods. We provide the first atomistic model of different surfaces on gold nanoparticles in a growing electrolyte solution, and we describe the interaction of the metal with the surfactants, namely, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and the ions. An innovative aspect is the inclusion of the role of the surfactants, which are explicitly modeled. We find that on all the investigated surfaces, namely, (111), (110), and (100), CTAB forms a layer of distorted cylindrical micelles where channels among micelles provide direct ion access to the surface. In particular, we show how AuCl2(-) ions, which are found in the growth solution, can freely diffuse from the bulk solution to the gold surface. We also find that the (111) surface exhibits a higher CTAB packing density and a higher electrostatic potential. Both elements would favor the growth of gold nanoparticles along the (111) direction. These findings are in agreement with the growth mechanisms proposed by the experimental groups of Murphy and Mulvaney.},

The coordination of the bifunctional ligand 1,10 phenantroline, 5,6 dione on the surface Ti(IV) ions provides open coordination sites for Fe(II) cations which are the starting point for the growth of a layer of Prussian blue polymer. The porous structure of the mesoporous TiO$_2$ allows the growth, ion by ion of the coordination polymer. Up to four layer of Prussian blue can be deposit without losing the porous structure of the film, which results in an enhanced response of these materials as H2O2 sensors. These porous confined PB modified electrodes are robust sensors that exhibit good reproducibility, environmental stability and high sensitivity towards H2O2 detection.},

abstract = {Nothing goes on forever. The years following World War II were very kind to chemistry. The research universities and the chemical industry—one of the most beneficial partner-ships our technologically sophisticated society has seen— developed the forms that we know. Industrial chemistry became a core part of the industrial world; academic chemistry explained how atoms and molecules made reality happen. How did it start? World War II generated a flood of technology relevant to chemistry. High-octane fuel and synthetic rubber were the first of many major expansions of the chemical industry. Catalysis—especially heterogeneous catalysis—became the core of large-scale synthesis. Methods to separate molecules revolutionized purification. New forms of spectroscopy uncloaked molecular structure. Quantum chemistry rationalized chemical bonds, and molecular orbital theory made these rationalizations relevant to complex molecules. Computers, and computer-aided simulations, be-gan their development. The technical and conceptual capa-bilities of chemistry increased enormously. At the same time, the economic reconstruction of Europe and Japan, and the rebuilding of the U.S. infrastructure, provided expansive commercial opportunities. Although the rapid growth of chemistry initially concentrated in the United States, it soon spread across the developed world. It was a very easy time for chemistry: complex organic synthesis, quantum chemistry, laser spectroscopy, production of polyolefins, organometallic chemistry, molecular beams, medicinal chemistry, and countless other areas developed and flourished. The range of commercial and scientific opportu-nities was very large. This prolific era is over, and chemistry is now facing classes of opportunities, and obligations to society, that are even more interesting, but entirely different. They will require—I believe—a new structure for the field, and raise a fundamental question: " What must chemistry be in the future? " It has been the field of science that studied atoms, bonds, molecules, and reactions. And 50 years from now? Will it still be the study of molecules and what they do? Or will it deal with complex systems that involve molecules, in any form—in materials science, biology, geology, city manage-ment, whatever— " chemical " or not? Any simple definition of the field of chemistry—or at least any definition as simple as " atoms, molecules, and reactions " —no longer seems to fit its potential, its obligations to society, or the complexity of the challenges it faces. Throughout the productive postwar period, " chemistry " always blended the practical and conceptual. This postwar era simultaneously developed academic chemistry—to analyze and understand complexity—and industrial chemistry—to produce the chemicals used by society. [1] The two are some-times described as separate, and even antagonistic. Far from it! The interchange between them—albeit usually unplanned and often haphazard—provided extraordinary benefits to both. The discovery of useful new phenomena—often in industry—offered starting points for academic scholarship. The universities, for their part, developed theoretical and mechanistic understanding, which reappeared in industry as better processes and new products. Academic research generated new analytical methods, which the manufacturers of commercial instrumentation converted into easily used, highly engineered, and indispensable tools for chemical research. Both industrial and university researchers devel-oped new synthetic methods and new materials. Computation and simulation changed the definition of an " experiment " for both. Everyone won. This stimulating exchange of informa-tion between academic and industrial laboratories continued until the 1980s, and then slowed. The post WW II era has now ended. Since the 1990s, the chemical industry has focused on process improvement, and has introduced few fundamentally new products. Although academic chemistry has migrated into new fields (biochem-istry, materials science, and computational chemistry are examples), and academic departments have proliferated, the historical core disciplines have drifted more toward " itera-tion " and " improvement " and away from " discovery. " The depletion of the vein of new ideas and commercial opportunities that marked the end of the postwar period was inevitable: nothing goes on forever. And the issue is certainly not that society has run out of problems for chemistry to solve. In fact, I would argue the opposite: that chemistry may now be the most important of the sciences in its potential to impact society. So: what are these new problems? How must chemistry change to address them? Whats next? The science and technology that developed in this period will continue as the foundation of whatever the field becomes, but the most urgent opportunities now lie in new directions. Exploiting},

abstract = {Filtration of molecules by nanometer-sized structures is ubiquitous in our everyday life, but our understanding of such molecular filtration processes is far less than desired. Until recently, one of the main reasons was the lack of experimental methods that can help provide detailed, microscopic pictures of molecule-nanostructure interactions. Several innovations in experimental methods, such as nuclear track-etched membranes developed in the 70s, and more recent development of nanofluidic molecular filters, played pivotal roles in advancing our understanding. With the ability to make truly molecular-scale filters and pores with well-defined sizes, shapes, and surface properties, now we are well positioned to engineer better functionality in molecular sieving, separation and other membrane applications. Reviewing past theoretical developments (often scattered across different fields) and connecting them to the most recent advances in the field would be essential to get a full, unified view on this important engineering question.},

When combined with improved biosensor design and advanced measurement systems, the on-line biochemical analysis of living cells in vitro has been applied for biological mechanism study, drug screening and even environmental monitoring. In recent decades, new types of miniaturized electrochemical biosensor are emerging with the development of microfabrication technology. This review aims to give an overview of the microfabricated electrochemical cell-based biosensors, such as microelectrode arrays (MEA), the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technique, and the light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). The details in their working principles, measurement systems, and applications in cell monitoring are covered. Driven by the need for high throughput and multi-parameter detection proposed by biomedicine, the development trends of electrochemical cell-based biosensors are also introduced, including newly developed integrated biosensors, and the application of nanotechnology and microfluidic technology.},

abstract = {Nanoparticle-mediated bio-sensing promoted the development of novel sensors in the front of medical diagnosis. In the present study, we have generated and examined the potential of titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) crystalline nanoparticles with aluminium interdigitated electrode biosensor to specifically detect single-stranded E.coli O157:H7 DNA. The performance of this novel DNA biosensor was measured the electrical current response using a picoammeter. The sensor surface was chemically functionalized with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) to provide contact between the organic and inorganic surfaces of a single-stranded DNA probe and TiO$_2$ nanoparticles while maintaining the sensing system's physical characteristics. The complement of the target DNA of E. coli O157:H7 to the carboxylate-probe DNA could be translated into electrical signals and confirmed by the increased conductivity in the current-to-voltage curves. The specificity experiments indicate that the biosensor can discriminate between the complementary sequences from the base-mismatched and the non-complementary sequences. After duplex formation, the complementary target sequence can be quantified over a wide range with a detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-13)M. With target DNA from the lysed E. coli O157:H7, we could attain similar sensitivity. Stability of DNA immobilized surface was calculated with the relative standard deviation (4.6%), displayed the retaining with 99% of its original response current until 6 months. This high-performance interdigitated DNA biosensor with high sensitivity, stability and non-fouling on a novel sensing platform is suitable for a wide range of biomolecular interactive analyses.},

abstract = {Two types of TiO(2) are used as mesoporous scaffolds, one (i) randomly sintered yielding an average pore size of 15-20 nm including bottlenecks of 1-3 nm (s-TiO(2)), the other (ii) prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly with a pore size of 7-9 nm (t-TiO(2)). The pore walls of these materials were post-grafted with phosphonic acids bearing one or two pyridinium or sulfonate head groups via 6, 10 or 14 methylene groups, in order to tune the free pore diameter and the surface charge over a broad range. The modification was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. Charge transport through the modified pores was investigated by cyclic voltammetry using [Fe(CN)(6)](4-/3-), [IrCl(6)](2-/3-) [Ru(NH(3))(6)](3+/2+), and (ferrocenylmethyl)trimethylammonium as electroactive tracer ions and La(3+) or naphthalene trisulfonate as non-electroactive species. The Faradaic current through the pores is controlled by the combination of surface charge, tracer ion charge, charge of the non-electroactive ions present, as well as the pore diameter. High currents due to strong preconcentration are observed, e.g. a partitioning coefficient value of 7 x 10(3) for [Fe(CN)(6)](4-/3-) on a modified electrode making it a candidate for ion-exchange voltammetry. Other phenomena presented are: (i) electrostatic closure of the porous system due to overlapping Debye layers, (ii) charge inversion of the pore walls, and (iii) the mode of charge propagation along the pore walls. Interestingly s-TiO(2) is more effective at building up an electrostatic barrier compared to t-TiO(2), probably because of narrow bottlenecks which interconnect the pores in s-TiO(2) only.},

abstract = {A robust and straightforward strategy allowing the controlled confinement of metal nanoparticles within the 3D framework of mesoporous films is presented. The chemical methodology is based on the inner surface modification of mesoporous silica films with polyelectrolyte brushes. We demonstrate that the macromolecular building blocks significantly enhance the site-selective preconcentration of nanoparticle precursors in the inner environment of the mesoporous film. Then, chemical reduction of the preconcentrated precursors led to the formation of metal nanoparticles locally addressed in the mesoporous structure. We show that the synergy taking place between two versatile functional nanobuilding blocks (ordered mesocavities and polymer brushes) can produce stable embedded nanoparticles with tuned optical properties in a very simple manner. As a general framework, the strategy can be easily adapted to different sets of polymer brushes and mesoporous films in order to regulate the monomer-precursor interactions and, consequently, manipulate the site-selective character of the different chemistries taking place in the film. We consider that the "integrative chemistry" approach described in this work provides new pathways to manipulate the physicochemical characteristics of hybrid organic-inorganic advanced functional assemblies based on the rational design of chemistry and topology in confined environments.},

Naturally hydrophobic PGs, based on o-nitrobenzyl chemistry, are used on polymer side chains, poised for cleavage upon exposure to UV light. Removal of the PGs liberates the hydrophilic polymer, thereby switching the surface wettability from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. This switch can be augmented by increasing the surface roughness. Additionally, this system is also shown to be spatially addressable, a highly desirable property for applications which require specific regions of a surface to switch their wettability.},

abstract = {The low-temperature formation of liquid-crystal-like arrays made up of molecular complexes formed between molecular inorganic species and amphiphilic organic molecules is a convenient approach for the synthesis of mesostructure materials. This paper examines how the molecular shapes of covalent organosilanes, quaternary ammonium surfactants, and mixed surfactants in various reaction conditions can be used to synthesize silica-based mesophase configurations, MCM-41 (2d hexagonal, p6m), MCM-48 (cubic Ia3d), MCM-50 (lamellar), SBA-1 (cubic Pm3n), SBA-2 (3d hexagonal P63/mmc), and SBA-3 (hexagonal p6m from acidic synthesis media). The structural function of surfactants in mesophase formation can to a first approximation be related to that of classical surfactants in water or other solvents with parallel roles for organic additives. The effective surfactant ion pair packing parameter, g ) V/a0l, remains a useful molecular structure-directing index to characterize the geometry of the mesophase products, and phase transitions may be viewed as a variation of g in the liquid-crystal-like solid phase. Solvent and cosolvent structure direction can be effectively used by varying polarity, hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties and functionalizing the surfactant molecule, for example with hydroxy group or variable charge. Surfactants and synthesis conditions can be chosen and controlled to obtain predicted silica-based mesophase products. A room-temperature synthesis of the bicontinuous cubic phase, MCM- 48, is presented. A low-temperature (100 °C) and low-pH (7-10) treatment approach that can be used to give MCM-41 with high-quality, large pores (up to 60 {\AA}), and pore volumes as large as 1.6 cm3/g is described.},

@article{Seah2005,
abstract = {A new general, predictive semi-empirical equation for the sputtering yields of mono-elemental solids, using 250-10,000 eV ions incident normally on the surface, has been developed. This equation is based on the approach of Matsunami et al. but includes a new atomic density term and avoids their arbitrary Q term. By analysing published experimental data for Ne, Ar and Xe sputtering yields, the accuracy of this approach may be evaluated. The standard deviations of the data for Ne, Ar and Xe are 14%, 9% and 14%, respectively and represent a very significant improvement on the semi-empirical approaches of Matsunami et al. and of Yamamura and Tawara. General predictive relationships are established to allow the approach to be used for any incident ions, however, it is expected that accuracies for low reactivity (inert gas) incident ions with masses in the range from Ne to Xe will be comparable to the above figures but extrapolation to lighter elements than Ne or heavier than Xe, or to reactive primary ions, should be treated with considerable caution.

The influence of the plasma parameters (plasma power and processing time) on the mesoscopic properties of silica films are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FT-IR, low-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and nitrogen adsorption isotherm. It is concluded that the plasma treatment is a promising way to remove organic templates and generate mesoporous thin films. Compared to the conventional thermal calcination methods, the plasma treatment provides a promising low-temperature, low-cost and time-saving preparation process.},

Substantial increase in mean particle size was observed by SEM image analysis after UV-induced grafting of methyl methacrylate onto pure silica particles. FT-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies of these materials revealed the successful grafting of methyl methacrylate onto the silica surface. The formation of a covalent bond between the grafted PMMA chains and silica surface was indicated by FT-Raman spectra.

abstract = {The transport of fluid in and around nanometer-sized objects with at least one characteristic dimension below 100 nm enables the occurrence of phenomena that are impossible at bigger length scales. This research field was only recently termed nanofluidics, but it has deep roots in science and technology. Nanofluidics has experienced considerable growth in recent years, as is confirmed by significant scientific and practical achievements. This review focuses on the physical properties and operational mechanisms of the most common structures, such as nanometer-sized openings and nanowires in solution on a chip. Since the surface-to-volume ratio increases with miniaturization, this ratio is high in nanochannels, resulting in surface-charge-governed transport, which allows ion separation and is described by a comprehensive electrokinetic theory. The charge selectivity is most pronounced if the Debye screening length is comparable to the smallest dimension of the nanochannel cross section, leading to a predominantly counterion containing nanometer-sized aperture. These unique properties contribute to the charge-based partitioning of biomolecules at the micro- channel-nanochannel interface. Additionally, at this free-energy barrier, size-based partitioning can be achieved when biomolecules and nanoconstrictions have similar dimensions. Furthermore, nanopores and nanowires are rooted in interesting physical concepts, and since these structures demonstrate sensitive, label-free, and real-time electrical detection of biomolecules, the technologies hold great promise for the life sciences. The purpose of this review is to describe physical mechanisms on the nanometer scale where new phenomena occur, in order to exploit these unique properties and realize integrated sample preparation and analysis systems},

The sensor consisted of eight iridium oxide sensing electrodes (0.78 mm(2) each), an iridium counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode patterned on a glass substrate. Four different capture antibodies were immobilized on the sensing electrodes via adsorption. Quantification of proteins was achieved using an ELISA in which the electrochemical oxidation of enzyme-generated hydroquinone was measured. The spatial separation of the electrodes enabled simultaneous electrochemical immunoassays for multiple proteins to be conducted in a single assay without amperometric cross-talk between the electrodes. The simultaneous detection of goat IgG, mouse IgG, human IgG, and chicken IgY was demonstrated. The detection limit was 3 ng/mL for all analytes. The sensor had excellent precision (1.9-8.2% interassay CV) and was comparable in performance to commercial single-analyte ELISAs. We anticipate that chip-based sensors, as described herein, will be suitable for the mass production of economical, miniaturized, multianalyte assay devices.},

abstract = {Rational design of fully synthetic platforms displaying active control over ionic transport in close resemblance to biological systems represents an ongoing challenge in molecular materials science. Here, we demonstrate that the synergism arising from the chemistries involved in mesoporous films and polymer brushes is a key enabler to next-generation "smart" nanofilters capable of mimicking the gating functions of specific biological channels. Hybrid functional assemblies constituted of mesoporous silica films modified with polyzwitterionic brushes are able to discriminate and gate the transport of cations while the passage of anionic species is precluded. The synthetic membranes behave as proton-gated cation-selective platforms mimicking the functioning of acid-sensing ion channels encountered in the neurons of the central nervous system. We believe that this experimental evidence will stimulate further multidisciplinary work across the boundaries of materials chemistry to attain new functional nanostructured interfaces with transport properties so far believed to be exclusive features of biological channels.},

abstract = {Abstract: Mercaptopropyl-functionalized silica spheres have been prepared by self-assembly co-condensation of mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) precursors in the presence of a cationic surfactant as templating agent and ammonia as catalyst. Several materials have been obtained by varying the MPTMS content from 5 to 100% in the synthesis medium, giving rise to a wide range of porous solids featuring different functionalization levels (denoted MPS-n%, with n ranging from 5 to 100) and distinct structural order/disorder over different length scales. They were characterized by N2 sorption isotherms, XRD, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and particle size analysis. Their reactivity in aqueous media was studied with respect to their binding properties toward HgII species by complexation with thiol groups. Total accessibility (expressed on the basis of a 1:1 S/Hg stoechiometry) was demonstrated and quantified for well-ordered materials containing up to 30% MPTMS. Less open structures characterized by a high degree of functionalization were subject to less-than-complete sorption capacities, while, however, reaching maximum loading values as high as 750 mg g-1. The speed of the uptake process was studied from batch experiments by using a fast electrochemical technique to monitor the consumption of the reactant, as a function of time, as a consequence of HgII sorption by the MPS materials. The associated apparent diffusion coefficients were calculated according to a spherical diffusion model, by appropriate fitting of the kinetic curves. They were strongly affected by both the structure and density of functional groups in the MPS sorbents. Whereas the long hexagonally packed one-dimensional channels of MPS-5% and MPS-10% may induce some diffusional restrictions for HgII to reach the binding sites located deep in the mesopores, transport issues within MPS-15% to MPS-30% sorbents is facilitated by a shorter range structural order in the form of three-dimensional wormhole framework structures. Increasing further the content of organic groups in the materials led to poorly ordered (MPS-40% and MPS-50%) and even amorphous (MPS-70% and MPS-100%) solids, resulting in considerable lowering of mass transfer rates, to which the concomitant increase of hydrophobicity may also contribute to a significant extent. The differences in sorption rates exhibited by MPS materials appear therefore to result from differences in their relative long-range versus short-range structural order/disorder and their intrinsic hydrophobicity, which are induced by their functionalization levels.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These materials, because of their very special properties such as high surface area, ordered porosity, versatile functionalization of the pore surface, have been widely used for developing advanced functional applications. Mesoporous ordered films have also shown a high capability of integration in current material processing technologies also taking advantage of the high flexibility of the synthesis. A surprisingly large variety of devices and applications have been developed so far which ranges from sensors to supercapacitors and biodevices. All these applications have in common the exploitation of ordered porosity on the mesoscale and in general a strong dependence on pore topology, the nature of the pore surface and pore accessibility has been demonstrated for most of the cases. Even if a high number of examples of applications have been reported still many more are expected to come in the near future.},

abstract = {We present a strategy toward controlled polymer density in mesopores by specifically adjusting the local amount of polymerization initiator at the pore wall. The polymerization initiator concentration as well as the polymer functionalization has a direct impact on mesoporous membrane properties such as ionic permselectivity. Mesoporous silica-based thin films were prepared with specifically adjusted amount of polymerization initiator (4-(3-triethoxysilyl)propoxybenzophenone (BPSilane)) or initiator binding functions ((3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)), directly and homogeneously incorporated into the silica wall pursuing a sol-gel-based co-condensation approach. The amount of polymerization initiator was adjusted by varying its concentration in the sol-gel precursor solution. The surface chemistry, porosity, pore accessibility, and reactivity of the surface functional groups were investigated by using infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray reflectometry, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We could gradually modify the amount of reactive polymerization initiators in these mesoporous membranes. Mesopores were maintained for APTES containing films for all tested ratios up to 25 mol % and for BPSilane containing films up to 15 mol %. These films showed accessible and charge-dependent ionic permselectivity and an increasing degree of functionalization with increasing precursor ratio. This approach can directly result in control of polymer grafting density in mesoporous films and thus has a direct impact on applications such as the control of ionic transport through mesoporous silica membranes.},

abstract = {Porphyrin adsorption on TiO$_2$ nanoparticles has been achieved for multiple porphyrins, and in mixed porphyrin assemblies, via axial ligation to surface-bound pyridine anchored by either para carboxylic or phosphonic functionalizations. Homogenous assemblies were prepared and characterized, while mixed metalloporphyrin assemblies were demonstrated by controlling the concentration ratios of respective porphyrins in the modifying solution. Evaluation of the assemblies using spectroscopic techniques and electrochemistry confirms high porphyrin retention, while exhibiting their surface bound optical and electrochemical properties. A thorough study is discussed where several metalloporphyrins have been evaluated (Ru(CO)OEP, Ru(CO)TPP, and ZnTPP) for relative comparisons and relationships to pyridyl axial binding strengths. The systematic study evaluates multiple background cases using either H2TPP, TiO$_2$ modification with benzoic acid, or unmodified TiO$_2$ to confirm the high affinity of Ru and Zn porphyrins for surface-anchored pyridyl sites. The simple method of step-by-step coordinative anchoring of porphyrins to TiO$_2$ using small, commercially available molecules is highly adaptable for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) where intimate contact between the absorbing dye and the semiconductor is required. DSSC devices with novel mixed porphyrin assemblies were shown to give higher power performance than DSSCs utilizing sensitization with only one type of porphyrin.},

abstract = {Proton exchange membrane fuel cells have the potential for applications in energy conversion and energy storage, but their development has been impeded by problems with the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate that a silicon-based inorganic-organic membrane offers a number of advantages over Nafion--the membrane widely used as a proton exchange membrane in hydrogen fuel cells--including higher proton conductivity, a lack of volumetric size change, and membrane electrode assembly construction capabilities. Key to achieving these advantages is fabricating a silicon membrane with pores with diameters of approximately 5-7 nm, adding a self-assembled molecular monolayer on the pore surface, and then capping the pores with a layer of porous silica. The silica layer reduces the diameter of the pores and ensures their hydration, resulting in a proton conductivity that is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of Nafion at low humidity. A membrane electrode assembly constructed with this proton exchange membrane delivered an order of magnitude higher power density than that achieved previously with a dry hydrogen feed and an air-breathing cathode.},

These theoretical results enable the delineation of the main factors that control the system reactivity and examination of their thermodynamic and kinetic effects to afford quantitative predictions for the optimization of the particles' dimensional characteristics for a targeted application. The validity and usefulness of the theoretical approach disclosed here are established by the presentation of the complete analysis of the performance of thiol-functionalized microspheres aimed for sequestration of Hg(II) ions from solutions to be remediated. This allows the comparison of the microparticles' performance at two different pH (2 and 4) and the rationalization of the observed changes in terms of the main microscopic parameters that define the system.},

The flow of the liquid is governed by a balance between centrifugal driving force and viscous resisting force. Radial variations in film thickness and concentration are neglected. The Galerkin/finite-element method is employed to solve the equation set. Film thinning slows initially due to decreasing film thickness and ceases finally due to dramatically increasing viscosity of the coating liquid as solvents evaporate, The formation of a region of extremely low solvent concentration and correspondingly high viscosity and low binary diffusivity at the free surface, Le., a solid "skin," is predicted. Coating defects can occur if convective flow has not completely ceased when this skin forms. Skin formation can be eliminated or delayed by partially saturating the overlying gas with solvent or by using mixed solvents (having both high and low volatilities) in the coating liquid. The temperature variation in the film during coating varies negligibly from the ambient.},

Electrochemical characterization of mass transport processes in pure and organically functionalized mesoporous oxide films is then discussed. The electrochemical response can be basically restricted by the electron/mass transfer reaction at the electrode-film interface and diffusion through mesopore channels. The contributions of cyclic voltammetry, hydrodynamic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electrochemical microscopy to the characterization of films with distinct mesostructures are finally described, with special emphasis on identification of conditions that can affect the electrochemical response recorded with such modified electrodes.},

abstract = {A nominally room temperature photochemical method, simply employing ultraviolet light(187-254 nm) generated ozone environment, is shown to provide an efficient alternative for the removal of surfactant templates for a routine production of mesoporous silica thin films at low temperatures. The treatment concomitantly strengthens the silicate phase by fostering the condensation of unreacted silanols leading to mesoporous thin films with well-defined mesoscopic morphologies. The surfactant/silicate thin film mesophases were prepared onto a polycrystalline Au surface by dip-coating or spin-casting methods using sub-critical micelle concentration (cmc) nonionic ethylene oxide surfactant in an oligomeric silica sol mixture. The structures and compositions of the thin film mesophases before and after exposure to UV/ozone were determined using a combination of reflection-absorption Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and thin film X-ray diffraction measurements. The pore characteristics of the UV/ozone-treated films were determined using nitrogen adsorption/desporption isotherm measurements. Results presented here clearly establish that the UV/ozone processing leads to complete removal of the surfactant template; strengthens the inorganic skeleton by fostering silica condensation; and renders the mesophase thin film surfaces highly hydrophilic. Two of the most attractive features of the method developed here, namely its usefulness in applications for temperature intolerant substrates (e.g., thin metal films) and in spatially selective removal of the surfactant templates to create patterns of mesoporous thin films, are also illustrated. Finally, the mechanistic implications of these observations are also discussed},

abstract = {Nanofluidic channels can be used to enhance surface binding reactions, since the target molecules are closely confined to the surfaces that are coated with specific binding partners. Moreover, diffusion-limited binding can be significantly enhanced if the molecules are steered into the nanochannels via either pressure-driven or electrokinetic flow. By monitoring the nanochannel impedance, which is sensitive to surface binding, low analyte concentrations have been detected electrically in nanofluidic channels within response times of 1-2 h. This represents a approximately 54 fold reduction in the response time using convective flow compared to diffusion-limited binding. At high-flow velocities, the presented method of reaction kinetics enhancement is potentially limited by force-induced dissociations of the receptor-ligand bonds. Optimization of this scheme could be useful for label-free, electrical detection of biomolecule binding reactions within nanochannels on a chip.},

abstract = {MSU-X materials are a family of ordered mesoporous silica obtained through an assembly mechanism between nonionic poly(ethylene oxide)-based surfactants and silica precursors. Until now, among many advantages, the main drawback of this synthesis was the cost of the silica source, a silicon alkoxide that prevented any application where large amounts of material are required. We report that a new two-step synthesis pathway implying first the stabilization of a microemulsion made of both nonionic surfactants and a silica source and then the silica condensation through a fluoride-helped catalysis can be extended to cheaper silica sources than the silicon alkoxide usually used. Both sodium silicate or colloidal silica lead to sodium- and fluoride-free materials that exhibit exactly the same structures and properties as those previously reported [Boissiere et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1999, 20, 2047]. In addition, with the process occurring in slightly acidic aqueous medium, at moderate temperatures, and in open-air containers, the use of both surfactant and low-cost silica reagents opens up the field of large-scale preparation for the mesoporous MSU-X silica.},

abstract = {We introduce the various options of experimentally observing mass transfer in mesoporous materials. It shall be demonstrated that the exploration of the underlying mechanisms is excessively complicated by the complexity of the phenomena contributing to molecular transport in such systems and their mutual interdependence. Microscopic diffusion measurement by the pulsed field gradient (PFG) technique of NMR offers the unique option to measure both the relative amount of molecules adsorbed and the probability distribution of their displacements over space scales relevant to fundamental adsorption science just as for technological application. These advantages are shown to have cared for a recent breakthrough in our understanding. The examples presented include the measurement of diffusion in purely mesoporous materials and the rationalization of the complex concentration patterns revealed by such studies on the basis of suitably chosen micro-kinetic models. As an interesting feature, transition into the supercritical state is shown to become directly observable by monitoring a jump in the diffusivities during temperature enhancement, occurring at temperatures notably below the bulk critical temperature. PFG NMR studies with hierarchical materials are shown to permit selective diffusion measurement with each of the involved subspaces, in parallel with the measurement of the overall diffusivity as the key parameter for the technological exploitation of such materials. We refer to the occurrence of diffusion hysteresis as a novel phenomenon, found to accompany phase transitions quite in general. Though further complicating the measuring procedure and the correlation between experimental observation and the underlying mechanisms, diffusion hysteresis is doubtlessly among the new options provided by diffusion studies for gaining deeper insight into the structure and dynamics of complex porous systems.},

abstract = {Gas adsorption measurements are widely used for determining the surface area and pore size distribution of a variety of different solid materials, such as industrial adsorbents, catalysts, pigments, ceramics and building materials. The measurement of adsorption at the gas/solid interface also forms an essential part of many fundamental and applied investigations of the nature and behaviour of solid surfaces. Although the role of gas adsorption in the characterisation of solid surfaces is firmly established, there is still a lack of general agreement on the evaluation, presentation and interpretation of adsorption data. Unfortunately, the complexity of most solid surfaces —especially those of industrial importance —makes it difficult to obtain any independent assessment of the physical significance of the quantities derived (e.g. the absolute magnitude of the surface area and pore size). A number of attempts have been made (see Note a), at a national level, to establish standard procedures for the determination of surface area by the BET-nitrogen adsorption method. In addition, the results have been published (see Note b) of an SCI/JUPACINPL project on surface area standards. This project brought to light a number of potential sources of error in the determination of surface area by the gas adsorption method. The purpose of the present Manual is two-fold: first to draw attention to the problems and ambiguities which have arisen in connection with the reporting of gas adsorption (physisorption) data; and second to formulate proposals for the standardisation of procedures and terminology which will lead to a generally accepted code of practice . The Manual does not aim to provide detailed operational instructions or to give a comprehensive account of the theoretical aspects of physisorption. The determination of the surface area of supported metals is not dealt with here — despite the importance of this topic in the context of heterogeneous catalysis —since this necessarily involves chemisorption processes. The present proposals are based on, and are in general accordance with, the Manual of Symbols and Terminology for Physicochemical Quantities and Units (see Note c) and Parts I and II of Appendix II (see Note d). Although it has been necessary to extend the terminology, the principles are essentially those developed in Part I.},

This model is found to predict film thick- ness values within 10% over the entire range of conditions explored, which gave film thicknesses from 10 nm to 33 pm. The model underpredicts film thickness for cases in which a very volatile solvent is used or the initial concentration of polymer is high, while overpredicting film thickness for cases in which a low volatility sol- vent is used or the initial polymer concentration is very low. These deviations are a consequence of how the model decouples fluid flow and solvent evaporation.},

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in new strategies to rapidly detect analytes of clinical and environmental interest without the need for sophisticated instrumentation. As an example, the detection of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as neurotoxins and organophosphates has implications for neuroscience, drug assessment, pharmaceutical development, and environmental monitoring. Functionalization of surfaces with multiple reagents, including enzymes and chromogenic reagents, is a critical component for the effective development of "dipstick" or lateral flow biosensors. Herein, we describe a novel paper-based solid-phase biosensor that utilizes piezoelectric inkjet printing of biocompatible, enzyme-doped, sol-gel-based inks to create colorimetric sensor strips. For this purpose, polyvinylamine (PVAm, which captures anionic agents) was first printed and then AChE was overprinted by sandwiching the enzyme within two layers of biocompatible sol-gel-derived silica on paper. AChE inhibitors, including paraoxon and aflatoxin B1, were detected successfully using this sensor by measuring the residual activity of AChE on paper, using Ellman's colorimetric assay, with capture of the 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate (TNB(-)) product on the PVAm layer. The assay provided good detection limits (paraoxon, approximately 100 nM; aflatoxin B1, approximately 30 nM) and rapid response times (<5 min). Detection could be achieved either by eye or using a digital camera and image analysis software, avoiding the need for expensive and sophisticated instrumentation. We demonstrate that the bioactive paper strip can be used either as a dipstick or a lateral flow-based biosensor. The use of sol-gel-based entrapment produced a sensor that retained enzyme activity and gave reproducible results after storage at 4 degrees C for at least 60 days, making the system suitable for storage and use in the field.},

The high redox cycling and collection efficiency of the IDAs ailowed electrochemical measurements to be highly sensitive (10 nmol/dm3), with a hlgh signal to noise ratio and a wide dynamic range (10 nmol/dm3 to 1 mmol/dm3). has been performed in a four-eiectrode configuratlon where step potential was applied to the generator electrode and constant potential was applied to the collector electrode in the IDA. The generator current reached steady state within a hundred miillseconds and the collector current was not affected by charging.

abstract = {Mesoporous silica thin films were shown to be an appropriate matrix for immobilization of discrete electroactive moieties, yielding uniform transparent thin film electrodes with defined texture and enhanced electrochemical activity. The mesoporous silica films prepared on conducting FTO-coated glass substrate were postsynthetically functionalized. Alkoxysilanes were used as precursors for subsequent grafting via ionic or covalent bonds of representative electroactive species, such as polyoxometalate PMo12O(40)3-, hexacyanoferrate(III), and ferrocene. The electrochemically active concentration within the silica-based composite electrodes achieves 90, 260, and 60 micromol cm(-3) for polyoxometalate, hexacyanoferrate(III), and ferrocene, respectively. The amount of molecules involved in the charge-transfer sequence is proportional to the film thickness and comparable to the total amount of embedded guests. Thus, eventually the whole bulk volume of the modified silica films is electrochemically accessible. Immobilization in the chemically modified silica matrix alters the redox potential of the electroactive molecules. Electron exchange between the adjacent redox centers (electron hopping) is proposed as a possible charge propagation pathway through the insulating silica matrix, which is supported by the fact that the high charge uptake is observed also for the hybrid electrodes with the covalently anchored redox guests.},

@article{Gorrepati2010,
abstract = {This study is the first to show that silica precipitation under very acidic conditions ([HCl] = 2-8 M) proceeds through two distinct steps. First, the monomeric form of silica is quickly depleted from solution as it polymerizes to form primary particles approximately 5 nm in diameter. Second, the primary particles formed then flocculate. A modified Smoluchowski equation that incorporates a geometric population balance accurately describes the exponential growth of silica flocs. Variation of the HCl concentration between 2 and 8 M further showed that polymerization to form primary particles and subsequent particle flocculation become exponentially faster with increasing acid concentration. The effect of salt was also studied by adding 1 M chloride salts to the solutions; it was found that salts accelerated both particle formation and growth rates in the order: AlCl(3) > CaCl(2) > MgCl(2) > NaCl > CsCl > no salt. It was also found that ionic strength, over cation identity, determines silica polymerization and particle flocculation rates. This research reveals that precipitation of silica products from acid dissolution of minerals can be studied apart from the mineral dissolution process. Thus, silica product precipitation from mineral acidization follows a two-step process--formation of 5 nm primary particles followed by particle flocculation--which becomes exponentially faster with increasing HCl concentration and with salts accelerating the process in the above order. This result has implications for any study of acid dissolution of aluminosilicate or silicate material. In particular, the findings are applicable to the process of acidizing oil-containing rock formations, a common practice of the petroleum industry where silica dissolution products encounter a low-pH, salty environment within the oil well.},

The results show that the organic functional groups are successfully grafted onto the nanosilica surface and the grafting ratio firstly increases and then decreases with the increasing MPTMS. In addition, four different grafting modes between nanosilica surface and MPTMS have been studied by DFT method.

abstract = {The gold nanocrystal seed-mediated approach using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a stabilizing surfactant is commonly used to make large quantities of monodisperse gold nanorods. This method, however, has been at times difficult to reproduce in different laboratories. We recently showed [Smith, D. K.; Korgel, B. A. Langmuir 2008, 24, 644-649] that a very low concentration impurity in CTAB obtained from some suppliers prevents nanorod growth but were not able to identify the impurity. Here, we report that the impurity is iodide. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) revealed that iodide concentrations vary in CTAB from different suppliers, from less than 2.75 ppm up to 840 ppm. When CTAB with iodide concentrations greater than 50 ppm is used, nanorods do not form and the product consists entirely of spherical nanocrystals. Iodide slows the reduction of Au(III) to Au0. Iodide adsorption on Au {111} surfaces inhibits nanorod growth.},

abstract = {Bottom-up surface processing with well-defined polymeric structures becomes increasingly important in many current technologies. Polymer brushes, that is, assemblies of macromolecules tethered at one end to a substrate, provide an exemplary system of materials capable of achieving such a goal. While the focus in the past decades has been mostly on their synthetic aspects and the in-depth study of their interesting properties, from several years now the core area of research has already started to shift towards specific practical applications. Ample functional versatility and relative ease of preparation are special strengths of polymer brushes, lending them a strong interdisciplinary character. To this end, this work is entirely dedicated to bringing together the latest research on applications of polymer brushes in multiple research fields. The aim of this review are twofold: first, to give a critical discussion of the current status of development of application-oriented research on polymer brushes, and second, to inform the reader as to what can be done with polymer brushes in multiple research fields. It is therefore hoped that the juxtaposition of perspectives from different disciplines in one place will stimulate and contribute to the ongoing process of cross-fertilization that is driving this fascinating and emerging area of polymer science. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, physical phenomena like the tensile strength effect, adsorbate phase transitions, and monolayer formation in combined micro- and mesoporous materials frequently lead to extra contributions in the adsorption isotherm. Models for pore size determination mostly do not account for this, and assignment to real pores leads to improper analysis of adsorption data. In this review, common pitfalls and limitations in the analysis of pore size distributions derived from adsorption isotherms of micro- and mesoporous materials are identified and discussed based on new results and examples reported in the recent literature. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Today various template-assisted synthesis methods facilitate the preparation of silica (SiO$_2$) as well as numerous metal oxides with well-defined, uniform and regular pore systems. The unique nanostructural properties of such materials are particularly useful for their application as active layers in gas sensors based on various operating principles, such as capacitive, resistive, or optical sensing. This review summarizes the basic aspects of materials synthesis, discusses some structural properties relevant in gas sensing, and gives an overview of the literature on ordered mesoporous gas sensors.},

abstract = {Polymer modification of mesoporous materials is a relevant topic for applications from sensing and separation to drug delivery. Especially the combination of structure and responsive, charged polymer functionalization opens new possibilities, such as gating of drug release. Thereby, zwitterionic polymers are interesting, because of their antifouling characteristics and their influence on ionic permselectivity. The control on polymerization in confinement of a mesopore including spatial polymer location is crucial for the resulting mesopore function such as ionic permselectivity. The amount of generated polymer and polymerization kinetics should be influenced by the confinement of mesopores: Diffusion is limited by the pore size, pore connectivity, and wall charge. These parameters influence termination, which depends on radical concentration and proximity. Concerning the total surface area, the size of the internal surface area of mesoporous materials largely dominates over the size of the outer surface area. This might tempt one to relate observed functionalization effects to the internal surface. Here, we investigate iniferter-initiated polymerization in thin mesoporous silica films concerning the type of iniferter, the generated amount of polymer, the polymerization inside the mesopores versus the external surface, and the used monomer. Our results clearly indicate potential bottlenecks of iniferter-initiated polymerizations in mesopores. The charge of the monomer can be crucial for the generated amount of polymer inside the mesopores and the exterior surface can dominate the polymerization. These results emphasize that polymer distribution in mesoporous materials must be analyzed carefully before data interpretation and that polymerization inside nanometer-sized pores can be controlled by confinement effects. We expect these results to have great impact, e.g., on the design of miniaturized separation and sensing devices, and to open new confinement-controlled functionalization strategies.},

The Ru-MPTAT-1 material showed very good catalytic activity in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for aryl halides and transfer hydrogenation reaction for a series of carbonyl compounds. The catalyst is easily recoverable from the reaction mixture and can be reused several times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity in the above reactions. Highly dispersed and strongly bound Ru(II) sites at the mesoporous polymer surface could be responsible for the observed high activity of the Ru-MPTAT-1 catalyst in these reactions.},

abstract = {Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy has been utilized to characterize the structure of porous silica gel films, both deposited on c‐Si substrates and free standing. The films were either dried at room temperature or subjected to partial densification at 400–450 °C. The spectra of the gel films are compared to those of thermal SiO$_2$ grown on c‐Si and to Kramers–Kronig analysis of the reflection spectra of bulk SiO$_2$ gels and v‐SiO$_2$. The gel films show small frequency shifts compared to the latter spectra and they also exhibit new bands due to the presence of OH groups, although very little molecular water or residual organic species were found. The results are interpreted in terms of the gel structure. Compared to the thermal oxide, the sharp peak near 1070 cm−1 is narrower for the gels and the spread in intertetrahedral angles is estimated at 24° and 27° for room temperature dried and partially densified gels, respectively, compared to 33° for the thermal oxide. This is in agreement with a state of strain in the Si—O—Si bridges of the gels near the surface of the pores. The gel films have also a stronger shoulder near 1200 cm−1, whose intensity decreases with heat treatment of the gel. Its nature is related to the longitudinal optical (LO) component of the high‐frequency vibration of SiO$_2$ and it is suggested that the gel pores may account for the activation of the LO component.},

Controlled conditions in the deposition, postsynthesis, and thermal treatment steps allow one to tailor the final mesostructure (2D hexagonal, p6m, or 3D cubic, Im3m). Various techniques were used to determine the time evolution of the mesostructure. Spectroscopic techniques (UV/vis, (17)O NMR) and EXAFS/XANES have been used to follow the chemical changes in the Ti(IV) environment. Crossing these techniques spanning all ranges permits a complete description of the chemistry all the way from solution to the mesostructured metal oxide. A critical discussion on all important chemical and processing parameters is provided; the understanding of these features is essential for a rational design and the reproducible construction of mesoporous materials.},

abstract = {This thesis deals with the recent efforts to elucidate the origin of the adsorption hysteresis phenomenon typical for mesoporous materials. Utilizing the capabilities of pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance, the macroscopic information, accessible by transient sorption experiments, and the microscopic information, pro- vided by the effective self-diffusivities, have been correlated and thus shown to yield further insight into the adsorption dynamics and the equilibrium properties of guest molecules in mesopores. In particular, two mechanisms of molecular transport, namely self-diffusion and activated redistribution of the fluid in the pores, have been elucidated. Basing on this finding, an explanation for the slowing down of the transient uptake with the onset of capillary condensation, observed in experiments, has been given. The activated nature of nucleation, growth and redistribution of the fluid phase inside the pores prevents equilibration on an experimental time scale. Adsorption behavior in electrochemically etched porous silicon with linear pores has been studied by means of Mean Field Theory. It has been shown that the direct- ing feature of many puzzling observations is the existence of a mesoscalic disorder, exceeding the disorder on an atomistic level. Thus, the linear, non-interconnected channels in mesoporous silicon turn out to exhibit all effects commonly associated with three-dimensional disordered networks.},

abstract = {We report on an IC compatible microfabrication process proposed for a novel monolithic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) with an electrochemical cell embedded in an electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) digital microfluidic device. The optimized process focused on the surface modification of Teflon, selective exposure for the electrochemical module and recovery of surface properties by one-step annealing at low temperature. The optimum modification time and annealing temperature were 20 s and 210 °C, respectively. The experimental results from atomic force microscope and contact angle (CA) measurement revealed the effects of surface roughness and apparent CA on the wettability for different etch times. The multifunctionality of droplet creation, merger and transportation in the EWOD microfluidic module and sensitive electrochemical detection for the redox probe were realized simultaneously. The proposed microfabrication process has many advantages of remarkable simplicity, prominent repeatability, low cost and compatibility with standard IC processes. It shows great promise for the microsystem of the microfluidic unit and detecting cell, and gives a brilliant conception for the future fabrication of monolithic LOC integrated with functional detection.},

abstract = {Solid state nanochannels modified with supramolecular architectures are a new and interesting class of stimuli-responsive nanofluidic element. Their fundamental understanding requires describing the behavior of soft-materials in confined geometries and its responses to changes in solution conditions. Here, a nanochannel modified with a polyelectrolyte brush is studied with a molecular theory that incorporates the conformational behavior of the polymers, electrostatic, van der Waals, and repulsive interactions coupled with the ability of the polymer segments to regulate their charge through acid-base equilibrium. The theory predicts pH-dependent ionic conductivity in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The polymer chains undergo large conformational changes triggered by variations in the outer solution environment and the conductivity of the device is shown to be controlled by the charge state of the polymer. The degree of polymer charge is largely affected by charge regulation and nanoconfinement effects. The molecular calculations show that the apparent pK(a) inside the pore departs from that in solution when increasing the curvature of the nanochannel.},

abstract = {The use of a multiple attachment sites strategy is considered in order to improve the stability of monomolecular adlayers. The hypothesis was tested in the case of PEG-ylated compounds carrying phosphonate groups, known for their affinity toward titanium oxide surfaces. As a result, a new class of co- and terpolymers were synthesized by free-radical polymerization of three different monomers: dialkyl(methacryloyloxyalkyl)phosphonates, PEG methyl ether methacrylate, and/or butyl methacrylate monomers. Adlayers were formed following a simple dip-and-rinse protocol using diluted aqueous polymer solutions and were characterized by evaluating their thicknesses with variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) and their elemental compositions with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The same techniques were used to determine changes of the adlayer as a function of exposure to electrolytes at different pH values and to monitor nonspecific protein adsorption upon serum exposures. The results indicated that the poly(alkyl-phosphonate)-based adlayers combine multiple site attachment of phosphonic groups and presentation of PEG side chains to the aqueous environment, resulting in both improved stability over a wide pH range in comparison to the tested reference surfaces and excellent resistance to protein adsorption when exposed to full human serum.},

abstract = {Using a sol-gel/spin coating method, the transparent metal(Ti, Cr)-containing mesoporous silica thin films could be prepared on quarts plates. In the case of the Ti-containing mesoporous silica (TMS) thin film, the formation of isolated and tetrahedrally-coordinated Ti oxide species in the frameworks was confirmed by XRD, UV-vis, and Ti K-edge XAFS measurements. The TMS thin film has been proved to exhibit a strong hydrophilic property even before UV irradiation compared to the common mesoporous silica and TiO$_2$ thin films. After UV-light irradiation, the contact angle of water droplet on the TMS thin film become extremely lower, indicating the appearance of the photo-induced super-hydrophilic property. We have also synthesized the transparent Cr-containing mesoporous silica (CMS) thin film containing tetrahedrally-coordinated Cr oxide species, which showed the super-hydrophilic property even under visible light irradiation. By using the polymerization ability of the isolated Cr oxide species under UV light irradiation, the polyethylene phase was successfully formed on the surface of the CMS thin film. It was demonstrated that the surface property of the CMS was converted into hydrophobic while keeping its transparency. The single-site Cr oxide moieties are responsible for the photo-induced surface reaction as well as controlling the surface hydrophilic-hydrophobic properties. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Monolayer G is obtained by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and transferred via poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to microfabricated Au electrodes, glass, and silicon. Post-synthesis treatments of G with PMMA and ozone (O3) showed 1 and 6 orders of magnitude decrease in film conductivity, respectively. The heterojunction formation with Au NPs had no major effect on G conductivity. In this work is demonstrated that G quenches more than 90% of the combined photoluminescence and fluorescence of Au NPs and Rhodamine B (RhB), respectively. Signal quenching permitted quantitative analysis of SERS of RhB on various substrates including as-transferred graphene, oxidized graphene (OG), and the heterojunction. While G is mainly responsible for quenching photoluminescence and fluorescence, ∼3 orders of magnitude increase SERS activity for RhB was accomplished by the heterojunction. Finally, we wanted to correlate changes in film current during UV light sensing experiments. We found striking differences in the sensing profiles at different UV energies.},

The related model parameters are compared with those of other SiOz samples, as crystals and glasses. Optical arrangements to detect and characterize layers of thicknesses down to 3 nm are discussed. In particular, it is shown that experiments with polarized light at oblique incidence up to 80 $\sim$ are a powerful tool to characterize those layers. Experiments are reported to determine, in addition, extrinsic properties such as B and P atoms in the oxide layer or defects due to an ion implantation treatment.

abstract = {The design of hybrid mesoporous materials incorporating polymeric assemblies as versatile functional units has become a very fertile research area offering major opportunities for controlling molecular transport through interfaces. However, the creation of such functional materials depends critically on our ability to assemble polymeric units in a predictable manner within mesopores with dimensions comparable to the size of the macromolecular blocks themselves. In this work, we describe for the first time the manipulation of the molecular transport properties of mesoporous silica thin films by the direct infiltration of polyelectrolytes into the inner environment of the 3D porous framework. The hybrid architectures were built up through the infiltration-electrostatic assembly of polyallylamine (PAH) on the mesopore silica walls, and the resulting systems were studied by a combination of experimental techniques including ellipso-porosimetry, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, among others. Our results show that the infiltration-assembly of PAH alters the intrinsic cation-permselective properties of mesoporous silica films, rendering them ion-permeable mesochannels and enabling the unrestricted diffusion of cationic and anionic species through the hybrid interfacial architecture. Contrary to what happens during the electrostatic assembly of PAH on planar silica films (quantitative charge reversal), the surface charge of the mesoporous walls is completely neutralized upon assembling the cationic PAH layer (i.e., no charge reversal occurs). We consider this work to have profound implications not only on the molecular design of multifunctional mesoporous thin films but also on understanding the predominant role of nanoconfinement effects in dictating the functional properties of polymer-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials.},

A cubic mesostructure was observed also by TEM. Template removal process was monitored by TG and FT-IR.

abstract = {A SYSTEM capable of converting chemical energy to mechanical energy could serve as an actuator or an 'artificial muscle' in several applications. Here we describe a chemomechanical system of this sort based on a synthetic polymer gel. The gel network is anionic, and positively charged surfactant molecules can therefore bind to its surface, inducing local shrinkage by decreasing the difference in osmotic pressure between the gel interior and the solution outside. By using an electric field to direct surfactant binding selectively to one side of the gel, we can induce contraction and curvature of a strip of gel. Reversing the direction of the field causes contraction of the opposite side, and when the gel is suspended in solution from a ratchet mechanism, it can thereby be made to move with a worm-like motion at a velocity of up to 25 cm min-1.},

The present paper reports on the large influence of the thermal stabilization and successive template removal on the pore structure of a mesostructured TiO 2 material using the diblock copolymer Brij 58 as surfactant. A controlled thermal stabilization (temperature and duration) allows one to tailor the final pore size and uniformity much more precise by influencing the self-assembly of the template. Moreover, also the successive thermal template removal needs to be controlled in order to avoid a structural collapse. N 2-sorption, TGA, TEM, FT-Raman spectroscopy, and small angle & wide angle XRD have been used to follow the crystal growth and mesostructure organization after thermal stabilization and after thermal template removal, revealing its effect on the final pore structure. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We have fully characterized the nanoparticles in terms of their physical parameters; size, surface area, internal pore size and structure. These data are all required if we are to make an informed judgement on the suitability of the structure for drug delivery in vivo. With these parameters in mind, we investigated the loading/ unloading profile of a model therapeutic into the pore structure of the nanoparticles. We demonstrate that the release can be controlled by capping the pores on the nanoparticles to achieve temporal control of the unloading. We have also examined the rate and mechanism of the degradation of the nanoparticles over an extended period of time. The eventual dissolution of the nanoparticles after cargo release is a desirable property for a drug delivery system.},

The EEP analysis is rapid and cheap and operates at ambient pressure and temperature. This latter experiment was performed with water and produced a set of water adsorption-desorption isotherms. A modified Kelvin equation, coupled with a modelisation of pores contraction, enabled the determination of the structural parameters of films porous networks: ellipsoidal pore diameters, porous volume, and surface area. Young moduli of films in the direction perpendicular to the substrates were calculated from these parameters.},

The films were prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition(PECVD) of silane (SiH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) mixtures, which were then diluted with He. The IR spectra were found to vary significantly with the degree of He dilution. Films grown with no He showed SiN, NH, and SiH bonding groups in addition to the three characteristic vibrations of the Si–O–Si linkage. The addition of He reduced the strength of the SiN, NH, and SiH absorption bands, and resulted in systematic increases in the frequency of the Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching vibration. The frequency of this Si–O–Si stretching vibration scales linearly with the oxygen concentration from approximately 940 cm− 1 in oxygen doped amorphous silicon to 1075 cm− 1 in stoichiometric noncrystalline SiO$_2$. A deposition temperature of 350 °C and a He dilution of 50% gave a film composition close to SiO1.9. We propose a model for the deposition process that emphasizes the role of the He dilution.},

The experiments are performed with films finished in the redox polycation (an osmium pyridine-bipyridine derivatized polyallylamine, PAH-Os) and the polyanion (polyvinyl sulfonate, PVS), in solutions of different electrolyte concentrations. A modified diffusion model is developed to account for the experimentally observed dependence of the average peak potential with the scan rate. This model is able to describe both the redox peak potential and the current, providing information on the electron-transfer rate constants and the diffusion coefficient for the electron-hopping mechanism. While the former does not vary with the ionic strength or the nature of the outmost layer, polyanion-capped films present an electron-hopping diffusion coefficient at low ionic strength that is three orders of magnitude smaller than that for PAH-Os-capped films. The effect is offset at high ionic strength. We discuss the possible causes of the effect and the important consequences for electrochemical devices built by layer-by-layer self-assembly, such as amperometric biosensors or electrochromic devices.},

@article{Zhuravlev2000,
abstract = {A review article is presented of the research results obtained by the author on the properties of amorphous silica surface. It has been shown that in any description of the surface silica the hydroxylation of the surface is of critical importance. An analysis was made of the processes of dehydration (the removal of physically adsorbed water), dehydroxylation (the removal of silanol groups from the silica surface), and rehydroxylation (the restoration of the hydroxyl covering). For each of these processes a probable mechanism is suggested. The results of experimental and theoretical studies permitted to construct the original model (Zhuravlev model-1 and model-2) for describing the surface chemistry of amorphous silica. The main advantage of this physico-chemical model lies in the possibility to determine the concentration and the distribution of different types of silanol and siloxane groups and to characterize the energetic heterogeneity of the silica surface as a function of the pretreatment temperature of SiO$_2$ samples. The model makes it possible to determine the kind of the chemisorption of water (rapid, weakly activated or slow, strongly activated) under the restoration of the hydroxyl covering and also to assess of OH groups inside the SiO$_2$ skeleton. The magnitude of the silanol number, that is, the number of OH groups per unit surface area, $\alpha$OH, when the surface is hydroxylated to the maximum degree, is considered to be a physico-chemical constant. This constant has a numerical value: $\alpha$OH,AVER=4.6 (least-squares method) and $\alpha$OH,AVER=4.9 OH nm−2 (arithmetical mean) and is known in literature as the Kiselev–Zhuravlev constant. It has been established that adsorption and other surface properties per unit surface area of silica are identical (except for very fine pores). On the basis of data published in the literature, this model has been found to be useful in solving various applied and theoretical problems in the field of adsorption, catalysis, chromatography, chemical modification, etc. It has been shown that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method is the correct method and gives the opportunity to measure the real physical magnitude of the specific surface area, SKr (by using low temperature adsorption of krypton), for silicas and other oxide dispersed solids.},

abstract = {This article describes a novel preparation method for highly hydrophilic porous thin films via photocatalytic removal of a structure-directing agent (SDA) under UV-light irradiation at ambient temperature. Since this technique requires no calcination process, it can effectively coat surfaces that have low thermal resistance, such as polymer substrates. In the present study, Ti-containing mesoporous silica thin films (Ti-MSTF) were prepared on polycarbonate and quartz substrates using a newly developed method involving UV-light irradiation. The film surface wettabilities were investigated by water contact angle measurements. Complete removal of the SDA was confirmed by time-dependent changes in the FT-IR spectra under UV-light irradiation, which also suggested that Ti-oxide moieties in the mesoporous silica framework play a crucial role in the removal of the SDA. XRD, UV-vis and XAFS measurements revealed that the Ti-MSTF had a mesoporous structure and isolated Ti-oxide moieties. The water contact angle measurements indicated that the Ti-MSTF exhibited highly hydrophilic property after photocatalytic removal of the SDA, and maintained this property under dark conditions for several days. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Their structural precision and diversity are discussed from the viewpoint of the topology of a metal-oxygen network. Supramolecular capsules of metal oxides are prepared by the self-assembly of polyoxometalates. Zeolites and mesoporous materials are synthesized by using organic molecules with their assemblies acting as templates. The topological networking of silsesquioxanes makes it possible to produce novel nanocomposites and microporous materials. In the final section, we demonstrate our recent studies into molecular imprinting, the encapsulation of a fluorescent dye, and the wrapping of individual polymer chains. Ultrathin, amorphous metal oxide films can retain the shape of organic molecules and can be used to create molecular composites by precisely wrapping individual molecules. These films are also effective in insulating molecular functions from external environments. The advantages of amorphous metal oxides are discussed in relation to the properties of the corresponding crystalline metal oxides and their potential prospects in nanotechnology.},

The porosity and pore size distribution of these thin films were investigated with a novel Environmental Ellipsometric Porosimetry (EEP) technique. Network crystallinity was assessed by XRD. In parallel, the evolution of the photocatalytic activity was studied through UV-induced photodegradation of methylene blue and lauric acid within the films at the various steps of the temperature treatment. The photoactivity was linked to the porous characteristics of the films and we concluded that the activity is optimal when the porosity is high and completely accessible, and when the nanoparticle and pore size have dimensions of 7.5 and 5.5 nm respectively. Such an optimal system was obtained after a sequential thermal treatment ending with 10 min at 600 [degree]C in air, for which the films adopts an ordered bidirectional grid-like structure.},

abstract = {This paper describes surface modification of commercial nanosilica with 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) and its effect on the properties of UV curable coatings. The mercapto groups were grafted onto nanosilica surface by a condensation of the surface Si-OH with the hydrolysized Si-OH of MPTMS. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and particle size distribution were employed to characterize nanosilica and modified nanosilica. It was demonstrated that the mercapto groups were successfully grafted onto the nanosilica surface with the grafting ratio of 16.8% and the mercapto groups content of 0.9 mmol/g. The dispersion and self-aggregation of nanosilica in UV curable coatings were improved significantly. The photopolymerization kinetics of UV curable coatings, containing various amounts of nanosilica and modified nanosilica, were evaluated by the photo differential scanning calorimetry technique. This indicated that nanosilica both before and after modification decreased UV curing speed and ultimate percentage conversion; however, in comparison with the coatings containing unmodified nanosilica, the coatings containing modified nanosilica exhibited higher curing speeds and conversion ratios. It can be ascribed that the mercapto groups on the nanosilica surface reduced oxygen inhibition during the UV curing process via the thiol-ene click reaction. The mechanical properties of UV curable coatings were also compared. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Coatings Association & Oil and Colour Chemists' Association.},

Redox peak current in cyclic voltammetry of Ru(NH3)63+ on the CHI/PVS and CHI/PAA film-coated electrodes increased with increasing thickness of the films. Interestingly, the cyclic voltammograms showed two pair of redox peaks, originating from Ru(NH3)63+ diffusing across the LbL layers and from those confined in the film. The results were rationalized in terms of the electrostatic interactions between Ru(NH3)63+ and excess negative charges in the LbL films originating from PVS and PAA. In contrast, Fe(CN)63− was not confined in the LbL films due to electrostatic repulsion of Fe(CN)63− and excess negative charges. Significant amounts of Ru(NH3)63+ were confined in the films at pH 7.0, whereas few ions were bound at pH 3.0 due to the reduced net negative charge in the films. The results suggest a potential use of the CHI-containing LbL films as scaffold for immobilizing positively charged ionic species on the electrode surface.},

To understand the details in controlled transport, it is necessary to gradually adjust the charge density that in turn results in a precise adjustment of permselectivity. We have created hybrid architectures through the controlled polymerization of a strong polyelectrolyte: (2-methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethylammounium (PMETAC) in a mesoporous thin silica film. PMETAC contents from 5 to 100% filling can be obtained by choosing a temperature or light-induced polymerization route and by varying polymerization times, as proven by ellipsoporosimetry and infrared spectroscopy. Using cyclic voltammetry, we demonstrate that a gradual variation of ionic permselectivity from a silanol-regulated to a PMETAC-regulated permselectivity can be obtained by tuning the PMETAC mesopore filling. The resulting behavior ranges from ion exclusion to preconcentration. The experimental observations are correlated with theoretical calculations that provide quantitative insights into the organization of the ions and polymers within the pore. Our findings shed light into the understanding of the interplay between charge density and space on molecular transport, leading toward the rational design of selectively transporting synthetic membranes.

abstract = {A molecular theory is presented to describe chemically modified   electrodes by redox polymers. The theory is based on writing the free\r\n   energy functional of the system which includes the size, shape, charge\r\n   distribution, and conformations of all of the molecular species as well\r\n   as all of the inter and intramolecular interactions, the acid-base\r\n   equilibrium for the ionizable groups of the weak polyelectrolyte, and\r\n   the redox equilibrium of the electrochemical active sites with the\r\n   metal. The minimization of the free energy leads to the molecular\r\n   organization of the film as a function of bulk pH, salt concentration,\r\n   and applied electrode potential. The approach is applied to the\r\n   experimental system composed by osmiurn pyridine-bipyridine complex\r\n   covalently bound to poly(allylamine) backbone, which is adsorbed onto a\r\n   mercapto-propane sulfonate thiolated gold electrode. The redox and\r\n   nonredox capacity of the electrode and its dependence on the electrode\r\n   potential calculated with the molecular theory shows very good\r\n   agreement with linear scan voltammetric experiments under reversible\r\n   conditions (equilibrium scans) without the use of any free adjustable\r\n   parameter. The predicted film thickness is in line with ellipsometric\r\n   measurements. Further, the theory predicts the swelling of the film as\r\n   a function of the electrode potential. The molecular theory provides\r\n   the link between the molecular organization within the film and the\r\n   electrochemical behavior. It is shown that the electrostatic, excluded\r\n   volume, and van der Waals interaction fields are strongly coupled in a\r\n   nontrivial way. Furthermore, the degree of charge regulation and\r\n   distribution of oxidized states couples to the molecular distributions\r\n   and the interaction fields. The application of the theory to different\r\n   model systems demonstrates the importance of incorporating molecular\r\n   information into the theoretical approach and the very strong coupling\r\n   that exists between molecular structure, film organization,\r\n   interactions fields, and electrochemical behavior.},

abstract = {The influence of polymer molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and polymer-solvent interactions on the thickness and topography of spin-coated polymer films was examined. For films prepared from dilute solutions, highly volatile solvents or fair or “poor” solvents for the polymer adversely affect film surfaces causing nonuniformities (waves) to appear. However, if the concentra- tion of these solutions is increased to approximately the concentration at which entanglements are formed, nearly uniform films are produced even if the solvent employed is highly volatile, such as dichloromethane. When toluene is employed as the solvent, which has a relatively low volatility and therefore forms nearly flat film surfaces, films prepared from dilute solution were found to have thick- nesses, h, proportional to 1)00-34 12-0.49 for polystyrene and v00.39 QP4' poly(methylmethacry1ate) where vo is the zero-shear rate solution viscosity and Q is the rotational speed at which the films were prepared. These results suggest that the exponents associated with vo and R may be nearly independent of the type of polymer used as long as flat films are produced. Finally, the molecular weight parameter most important in controlling final film thickness for films made from dilute solutions is Mu, the viscosity-average molecular weight.},

abstract = {Physical and electrochemical features of nanoporous electrodes arising from their morphology are presented in this perspective. Although nanoporous electrodes have been used to enhance electrocatalysis for several decades, the origin of their capability was understood on the basis of enlarged surface area or crystalline facet. However, considerable attention should be paid to the fact that nano-confined space of nanoporous electrodes can significantly affect electrochemical efficiency. Molecular dynamics in nano-confined spaces is capable of offering much more chances of interaction between a redox molecule and an electrode surface. The mass transport in the nanoporous electrode depends on various pore characteristics such as size, shape, charge, connectivity, and symmetry as well as molecular properties such as size, charge, and kinetics. Moreover, when the pore size is comparable to the thickness of an electric double layer (EDL), the EDLs overlap in the porous structure so that electrochemically effective surface area is not the same as that of the real electrode surface. These unique properties come from simply nanoporous structure and suggest new opportunity to innovative electrocatalysts in the future.},

An expanding area is concerned with the control of fluids and species in microchannels by means of an electric field. This paper discusses a new class of Si-compatible porous oxide interconnects for gateable transport of ions. The integration of such thin oxide films in microfluidics devices has been hampered in the past by the compatibility of oxides with silicon technology. A general fabrication method is given for the manufacture of silicon microsieve support structures by micromachining, on which a thin oxide layer is deposited by the spin-coating method. The deposition method was used for constructing gamma-alumina, MCM-48 silica, and amorphous titania films on the support structures, from both water-based and solvent-based oxide sols. The final structures can be applied as microporous and mesoporous interconnecting walls between two microchannels. It is demonstrated that the oxide interconnects can be operated as ion-selective electrophoretic gates. The interconnects suppress Fick diffusion of both charged and uncharged species, so that they can be utilized as ionic gates with complete external control over the transport rates of anionic and cationic species, thus realizing the possibility for implementation of these Si-compatible oxide interconnects in microchip analyses for use as dosing valves or sensors.},

Mesoporous CNTs@SiO$_2$ composites have been obtained by extracting cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) via an ion-exchange procedure after silica-coated carbon nanotubes were synthesized with the aid of the cationic surfactant CTAB. The coating process was explicitly investigated, and a possible formation mechanism of the mesoporous CNTs@SiO$_2$ was proposed, which reveals that the ratio of CTAB/CNTs plays a critical role in the coating process. Furthermore, the pore size of the as-prepared mesoporous silica could be exactly controlled by using different amounts of the bromide surfactant CTAB. The obtained mesoporous CNTs@SiO$_2$ composite nanomaterial was evaluated with three typical proteins, cytochrome c (Cyt c), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (Lyz), with different molecular sizes. The adsorption and desorption of binary mixtures of Cyt c and BSA, Cyt c and Lyz, and a ternary mixture of Cyt c, BSA and Lyz showed that the mesoporous CNTs@SiO$_2$ are effective and highly selective adsorbents for Cyt c. The as-prepared mesoporous CNTs@SiO$_2$ composites have shown effective performance in size-selective adsorption of biomacromolecules, demonstrating great potential in biomacromolecular separation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For bioanalytical systems sensitivity and biomolecule activity are critical issues. The immobilization of proteins into multilayer systems by the layer-by-layer deposition has become one of the favorite methods with this respect. Moreover, the combination of nanoparticles with biomolecules on electrodes is a matter of particular interest since several examples with high activities and direct electron transfer have been found. Our study describes the investigation on silica nanoparticles and the redox protein cytochrome c for the construction of electro-active multilayer architectures, and the electron transfer within such systems. The novelty of this work is the construction of such artificial architectures with a non-conducting building block. Furthermore a detailed study of the size influence of silica nanoparticles is performed with regard to formation and electrochemical behavior of these systems.\n\nRESULTS: We report on interprotein electron transfer (IET) reaction cascades of cytochrome c (cyt c) immobilized by the use of modified silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to act as an artificial matrix. The layer-by-layer deposition technique has been used for the formation of silica particles/cytochrome c multilayer assemblies on electrodes. The silica particles are characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Zeta-potential and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The modified particles have been studied with respect to act as an artificial network for cytochrome c and to allow efficient interprotein electron transfer reactions. We demonstrate that it is possible to form electro-active assemblies with these non-conducting particles. The electrochemical response is increasing linearly with the number of layers deposited, reaching a cyt c surface concentration of about 80 pmol/cm2 with a 5 layer architecture. The interprotein electron transfer through the layer system and the influence of particle size are discussed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability to construct fully electro-active cyt c multilayer assemblies by using carboxy-modified silica nanoparticles. Thus it can be shown that functional, artificial systems can be build up following natural examples of protein arrangements. The absence of any conductive properties in the second building block clearly demonstrates that mechanisms for electron transfer through such protein multilayer assemblies is based on interprotein electron exchange, rather than on wiring of the protein to the electrode.The construction strategy of this multilayer system provides a new controllable route to immobilize proteins in multiple layers featuring direct electrochemistry without mediating shuttle molecules and controlling the electro-active amount by the number of deposition steps.},

abstract = {This review presents and discusses recent advances in the emerging field of "gated nanochemistry", outlining the substantial progress made so far. The development of hybrid mesoporous silica with complex tailored pore nanoarchitectures bridges the gap between molecular materials and the requirements of nanodevices for controlled nanoscale chemistry. In the last decade, membranes, particles and thin film porous architectures have been designed, synthesized and selectively modified by molecular, polymeric, organometallic or biologically active groups. The exquisite manipulation of mesopore morphology and interconnection combined with molecular or supramolecular functionalities, and the intrinsic biological compatibility of silica have made these materials a potential platform for selective sensing and drug delivery. The wide r{\'{e}}pertoire of these hard-soft architectures permit us to envisage sophisticated intelligent nano-systems that respond to a variety of external stimuli such as pH, redox potential, molecule concentration, temperature, or light. Transduction of these stimuli into a predefined response implies exploiting spatial and physico-chemical effects such as charge distribution, steric constraints, equilibria displacements, or local changes in ionic concentration, just to name a few examples. As expected, this "positional mesochemistry" can be only attained through the concerted control of assembly, surface tailoring and, confinement conditions, thus giving birth to a new class of stimuli-responsive materials with modulable transport properties. As a guiding framework the emerging field of "gated nanochemistry" offers methodologies and tools for building up stimuli-sensitive porous architectures equipped with switchable entities whose transport properties can be triggered at will. The gated nanoscopic hybrid materials discussed here not only herald a new era in the integrative design of "smart" drug delivery systems, but also give the reader a perspective of the promising future in the development of mesoporous platforms that can control mass transport on command through the combination of flexible supramolecular routes, with implications on health, environment and energy.},

Capture antibodies were immobilized in a 4.5-nm-thick double layer of a hexamethyldisiloxane plasma-polymerized film. Because of their highly cross-linked network structure, the capture antibodies could be firmly immobilized. No nonspecific adsorption was observed during a series of procedures to detect target proteins, and electrochemical cross talk between neighboring sites was negligible. The sandwich immunoassay was conducted on a single chip using model proteins, alpha-1-fetoprotein and beta2-microglobulin. A distinct current increase following the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide produced by the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase was observed, which indicates that the capture proteins could actually bind the target proteins. Two kinds of protein were detected independently on multiple sites with respective capture antibodies.},

abstract = {This critical review presents and discusses the recent advances in complex hybrid materials that result from the combination of polymers and mesoporous matrices. Ordered mesoporous materials derived from supramolecular templating present high surface area and tailored pore sizes; pore surfaces can be further modified by organic, organometallic or even biologically active functional groups. This permits the creation of hybrid systems with distinct physical properties or chemical functions located in the framework walls, the pore surface, and the pore interior. Bringing polymeric building blocks into the game opens a new dimension: the possibility to create phase separated regions (functional domains) within the pores that can behave as "reactive pockets" of nanoscale size, with highly controlled chemistry and interactions within restricted volumes. The possibilities of combining "hard" and "soft" building blocks to yield these novel nanocomposite materials with tuneable functional domains ordered in space are potentially infinite. New properties are bound to arise from the synergy of both kinds of components, and their spatial location. The main object of this review is to report on new approaches towards functional polymer-inorganic mesostructured hybrids, as well as to discuss the present challenges in this flourishing research field. Indeed, the powerful concepts resulting from the synergy of sol-gel processing, supramolecular templating and polymer chemistry open new opportunities in the design of advanced functional materials: the tailored production of complex matter displaying spatially-addressed chemistry based on the control of chemical topology. Breakthrough applications are expected in the fields of sustainable energy, environment sensing and remediation, biomaterials, pharmaceutical industry and catalysis, among others (221 references).},

@book{Brinker1990,
abstract = {Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing presents the physical and chemical principles of the sol-gel process. The book emphasizes the science behind sol-gel processing with a chapter devoted to applications. The first chapter introduces basic terminology, provides a brief historical sketch, and identifies some excellent texts for background reading. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss the mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation for nonsilicate and silicate systems. Chapter 4 deals with stabilization and gelation of sols. Chapter 5 reviews theories of gelation and examines the predicted and observed changes in the properties of a sol in the vicinity of the gel point. Chapter 6 describes the changes in structure and properties that occur during aging of a gel in its pore liquor (or some other liquid). The discussion of drying is divided into two parts, with the theory concentrated in Chapter 7 and the phenomenology in Chapter 8. The structure of dried gels is explored in Chapter 9. Chapter 10 shows the possibility of using the gel as a substrate for chemical reactions or of modifying the bulk composition of the resulting ceramic by performing a surface reaction (such as nitridation) on the gel. Chapter 11 reviews the theory and practice of sintering, describing the mechanisms that govern densification of amorphous and crystalline materials, and showing the advantages of avoiding crystallization before sintering is complete. The properties of gel-derived and conventional ceramics are discussed in Chapter 12. The preparation of films is such an important aspect of sol-gel technology that the fundamentals of film formation are treated at length in Chapter 13. Films and other applications are briefly reviewed in Chapter 14. Materials scientists and researchers in the field of sol-gel processing will find the book invaluable},

abstract = {Periodically ordered mesoporous titania thin films (MTTF) present a high surface area, controlled porosity in the 2-20 nm pore diameter range and an amorphous or crystalline inorganic framework. These materials are nowadays routinely prepared by combining soft chemistry and supramolecular templating. Photocatalytic transparent coatings and titania-based solar cells are the immediate promising applications. However, a wealth of new prospective uses have emerged on the horizon, such as advanced catalysts, perm-selective membranes, optical materials based on plasmonics and photonics, metamaterials, biomaterials or new magnetic nanocomposites. Current and novel applications rely on the ultimate control of the materials features such as pore size and geometry, surface functionality and wall structure. Even if a certain control of these characteristics has been provided by the methods reported so far, the needs for the next generation of MTTF require a deeper insight in the physical and chemical processes taking place in their preparation and processing. This article presents a critical discussion of these aspects. This discussion is essential to evolve from know-how to sound knowledge, aiming at a rational materials design of these fascinating systems.},

Here, we demonstrate that the synergism arising from the chemistries involved in mesoporous films and polymer brushes is a key enabler to next-generation "smart" nanofilters capable of mimicking the gating functions of specific biological channels. Hybrid functional assemblies constituted of mesoporous silica films modified with polyzwitterionic brushes are able to discriminate and gate the transport of cations while the passage of anionic species is precluded. The synthetic membranes behave as proton-gated cation-selective platforms mimicking the functioning of acid-sensing ion channels encountered in the neurons of the central nervous system. We believe that this experimental evidence will stimulate further multidisciplinary work across the boundaries of materials chemistry to attain new functional nanostructured interfaces with transport properties so far believed to be exclusive features of biological channels.},

abstract = {Ordered mesoporous materials prepared by the template route have attracted increasing interest from the electrochemists community due to their plenty of unique properties and functionalities that can be effectively exploited in electrochemical devices. This review will cover the whole field of the intersection between electrochemistry and ordered mesoporous materials. The latter are either electronically insulating (silica and some other metal oxides, as well as silica-based organic-inorganic hybrid materials), semi-conducting (metal oxides), or conducting (metals, carbons). The three main intersection areas are: (1) the development/use of electrochemical methods to characterize the properties of mesoporous materials (i.e., charge and mass transfer processes); (2) the generation of mesostructured solids by electro-assisted deposition using appropriate templates; and (3) the application of these novel materials for electrochemical purposes. The most common devices to date are based on a bulk composite or thin film configuration and the resulting electrodes modified with such mesoporous materials have been successfully applied in various fields, including mainly electrochemical sensing and biosensing as well as energy conversion and storage (620 references).},

@article{Beck1992,
abstract = {The synthesis, characterization, and proposed mechanism of formation of a new family of silicatelaluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves designated as M41S is described. MCM-41, one member of this family, exhibits a hexagonal arrangement of uniform mesopores whose dimensions may be engineered in the range of - 15 A to greater than 100 A. Other members of this family, including a material exhibiting cubic symmetry, have ken synthesized. The larger pore M41S materials typically have surface areas above 700 m2/g and hydrocarbon sorption capacities of 0.7 cc/g and greater. A templating mechanism (liquid crystal templating-LCT) in which surfactant liquid crystal structures serve as organic templates is proposed for the formation of these materials. In support of this templating mechanism, it was demonstrated that the structure and pore dimensions of MCM-41 materials are intimately linked to the properties of the surfactant, including surfactant chain length and solution chemistry. The presence of variable pore size MCM-41, cubic material, and other phases indicates that M41S is an extensive family of materials.},

abstract = {Electronic tongue systems are multisensor devices dedicated to automatic analysis of complicated composition samples and to the recognition of their characteristic properties. Recently, the number of publications covering this topic has significantly increased. Many possible architectures of such devices were proposed: potentiometric, voltammetric, as well as approaches embracing mass- and optical-sensors. For the analysis of sensor array data, various pattern recognition systems were proposed. All of these topics are summarized in this review. Moreover, additional problems are considered: miniaturization of electronic tongues and hybrid systems for liquid sensing.},

@article{Fattakhova-Rohlfing2007,
abstract = {Organized mesoporous layers of SiO$_2$ with narrow pore size distribution centered at ca. 7 nm, which were uniformly functionalized with readily protonated amino groups, exhibit excellent permselective membrane properties. Their selectivity and permeability can be reversibly controlled by changing pH. The flux of hexacyanoferrate Fe(CN)63- anions, hexaamino-ruthenium Ru(NH3)63+ cations, and neutral ferrocene methanol molecules through the amino functionalized silica layers was monitored by cyclic voltammetry at different solution pH values. Depending on their charges, the flux of ions can be completely blocked or enhanced, while the permeation of uncharged species is affected adversely only in a limited extent by the change in pH. The high membrane porosity ensures fast penetration rates of the analytes and much faster response to the changes in pH compared to those of typical compact organic polymer layers. As the amino functionalized mesoporous silica layers enable the efficient separation of differently charged species from complex mixtures, they are attractive for applications in biology and medicine, where such mixtures are often encountered, e.g., for the separation of blood, urine, or sera components.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {We investigated how surface chemistry influences the interaction between gold nanorods (AuNRs) and cell membranes and the subsequent cytotoxicity arising from them in a serum-free cell culture system. Our results showed that the AuNRs coated with cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) molecules can generate defects in the cell membrane and induce cell death, mainly due to the unique bilayer structure of CTAB molecules on the surface of the rods rather than their charge. Compared to CTAB-capped nanorods, positively charged polyelectrolyte-coated, i.e. poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDAC), AuNRs show improved biocompatibility towards cells. Thus, the present results indicate that the nature of surface molecules, especially their packing structures on the surface of AuNRs rather than surface charge, play a more crucial role in determining cytotoxicity. These findings about interfacial interactions could also explain the effects of internalized AuNRs on the structures or functions of organelles. This study will help understanding of the toxic nature of AuNRs and guide rational design of the surface chemistry of AuNRs for good biocompatibility in pharmaceutical therapy.},
